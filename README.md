#  life cycle :  what happens to a component from the moment it appears on the screen until it is removed.

1. Initialization (This is the "component preparation" stage.)
- Initialize State  => class component , Function component (useEffect ) 
- props component (the Information parent => Child )
- Initialize Variables
- constructor In class component
2. Mounting (Appear The Component At The First Time In Dom  )
- This is when the component is created and added to the DOM.
3. Updating 
4. Unmounting 


#  Full Process 

1.  index.html – The Entry Point <div id="root"></div>
2.  src/main.jsx – The Real Starting Point

 - react-dom/client  => connect React To Dom (create Root Function )
 - In Html root id  <div id="root"></div> => this is container 
 # React يأخذ <App /> ويحوّله لشجرة Virtual DOM.
